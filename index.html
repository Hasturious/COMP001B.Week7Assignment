            <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
            <p>I find myself worrying about learning things the wrong way and that messing with things I learn later. The in class lectures leviate these worries as I can confirm that my interpration of concepts are fine.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question2">
            <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
            <p>The week 2 assignment did feel like a "dificulty spike" but as you were generous with the grading I think you handled it well as the assignment does encourage students to do a lot of research and self-learning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question3">
            <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course? </h1>
            <p>I had somewhat of an idea on what CSS is about from the previous HTML class. I was expecting to learn new fomating methods and new CSS syntax which was covered in this class.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question4">
            <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
            <p>As someone who has only worked with languages such as Python the idea of stylesheets was completely foreign to me. Although the basics of CSS was explored in the HTML class earlier this semester all of the concepts past week 2 were entirely new.</p>
